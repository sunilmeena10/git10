Installation:

The recommendation for installing the AWS CLI is to use the bundled installer provided by AWS. The bundled installer includes all dependencies required for the installation.

1. To begin the installation run the following command:

curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
2. Next, you must unzip the downloaded package from step 1:

unzip awscli-bundle.zip
3. Once the package in unzipped, you can run the installation:

sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
Using the -b option allows all users to use the AWS CLI from any directory, meaning you will not need to specify the install directory in the userâ€™s $PATH variable.
